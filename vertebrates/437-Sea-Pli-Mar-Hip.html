                    This is a beautiful fossil of a seahorse from a long-closed site in Italy. True fossil seahorses (genus <i>Hippocampus</i>) are very rare in the fossil record, much more so than the similar-looking pipefish. Both belong to the Syngnathidae ("together+jaw"), a family of fishes named for and characterized by their fused, toothless jaws. Seahorses also possess flexible prehensile tails used for holding onto mates or substrates. <i>H. ramulosus</i> is actually a species that still exists today.<br><br>Measuring at 12 cm, this specimen is probably among the largest and best-preserved of its kind that I've ever seen.
