            Exochocrinus is a highly-unusual crinoid which lacked a stem and presumably lived a benthic lifestyle on the seafloor, similar to the likewise stemless Agassizocrinus and Staphylocrinus. These crinoids fused their infrabasal plates into singular solid infrabasal disks/cones, and likely detached from the stem during development like modern free-swimming comatulid crinoids (Burdick & Strimple 1969). Notably, this genus has exceptionally bulbous, tumid (i.e. swollen) calyx plates giving it a "bubbly" appearance. The main trait that distinguishes this crinoid from the closely-related Staphylocrinus is its very small, flat, and nearly pentagonal infrabasal disk that lies within a deep basal concavity, as well as significantly larger and more bulbous basal plates on which it probably sat in life. "Exochocrinus tumulosus" is the only species of Exochocrinus described from North America. However, the genus is a relatively poorly-understood taxon and I lack the expertise to identify this specimen with certainty.<br><br>Addendum: To my surprise, upon closer examination there appears to be a significant length of extraordinarily thin, delicate stem still attached to the infrabasal disk of this specimen. All characterizations of "E. tumulosus" in the literature describe a complete lack of any stem, along with a columnar cicatrix (i.e. scar) on the infrabasal disk. I don't believe this peculiarity can simply be attributed to immaturity, because this specimen is well-within the size range of presumably mature Exochocrinus specimens in the literature. In any case, this stem was almost certainly too weak to elevate the crinoid up in the water, and probably worked more as a tether akin to a "ball and chain", if it was functional at all. In addition, in my opinion the infrabasal disk on this specimen is closer to a proper pentagon with rounded vertices, as opposed to typical "E. tumulosus" whose infrabasal disk appears nearly star-shaped due to its sharp, "pinched out" vertices. This specimen may be an aberrant example of "E. tumulosus" or perhaps a new species of Exochocrinus altogether.
