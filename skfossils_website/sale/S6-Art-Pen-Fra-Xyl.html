            Here is a very special fossil: a millipede from the famous Mazon Creek Lagerstatte of Illinois (Francis Creek Shale). I myself know very little about mazon creek fossils, but the identification as "Xyloiulus sp." was provided by Jack Wittry of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. He is a Mazon Creek expert who wrote the books "The Mazon Creek Fossil Fauna" and "The Mazon Creek Fossil Flora", which are regarded as comprehensive taxonomic guides for fossils from this locality.<br><br>Supposedly Xyloiulus is an especially rare genus even among the rare mazon creek millipedes; characterized by short legs and vertically undivided body segments. I should mention however that I have also been told by a couple knowledgeable collectors that the specimen bears some resemblance to the genus "Euphoberia". I don't really have the expertise to make a definitive conclusion either way, but have laid out the information and assessments that I have been provided.<br><br>The specimen itself shows clear segmentation, beautiful 3-dimensional preservation in parts, and even the proximal portions of some its legs which could perhaps be further prepped out. That being said, I have never seen a mazon creek Xyloiulus for sale before, so I don't have the best frame of reference.
