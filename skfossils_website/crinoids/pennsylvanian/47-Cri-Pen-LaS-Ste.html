            This species is one of the more common constituents of the Pontiac crinoid fauna, but no less popular or beautiful for it. Stellarocrinus exhibits very widely-spraddled/well-separated thick biserial arms, along with a very shallow, highly-sculpted calyx, which gives its crown a very distinct appearance. The biserial arms also exemplify the emergence of so-called "advanced cladids" in the Pennsylvanian; a departure from the typical cladid arrangement of uniserial pinnulate arms. Officially, the ornamentation of the calyx and presence/absence of axillary spines on the arms distinguish different species of the genus. However I am not personally fully convinced of this distinction, because it seems these features are highly variable and intermediate forms seem to exist.
