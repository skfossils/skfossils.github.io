            Crinoids of Pennsylvanian and Permian age are generally rare in the fossil record, especially articulated crowns. That being said, there are a few "hotspots", one of them being the Permian of Timor, Indonesia where this specimen comes from. The initial description of this fauna was done about 100 years ago by Wanner (with very little work since) and does not seem readily available for reference; it is also entirely in German which complicates things further. According to Georgy Mirantsev, it does not seem like this particular crinoid is figured in Wanner's work, so it may be new/undescribed.
