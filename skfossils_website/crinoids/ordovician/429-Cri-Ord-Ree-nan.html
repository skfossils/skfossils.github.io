          <p>
            An unidentified crinoid calyx with some stem and a bit of pinnulated arm. The large, many-plated calyx suggests this is a Camerate crinoid, and from what I can tell it seems to have stellate ornamentation on its calyx plates as well. Perhaps some further prep could help identification, though I dare not touch it myself. This is from the Reedsville Shale, which if I understand correctly is a part of the Martinsburg Formation; this is the formation exposed at (or at least used to be exposed at) Swatara Gap of Pennsylvania, which prolifically produced starfish, brittle stars, trilobites and occasionally crinoids.
