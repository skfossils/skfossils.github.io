                    Here is a very special fossil: a millipede from the famous Mazon Creek Lagerstatte of Illinois (Francis Creek Shale). I myself know very little about mazon creek fossils, but the identification as <i>Xyloiulus sp.</i> was provided by Jack Wittry of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. He is a Mazon Creek expert who wrote the books "The Mazon Creek Fossil Fauna" and "The Mazon Creek Fossil Flora", which are regarded as comprehensive taxonomic guides for fossils from this locality.<br><br>Supposedly <i>Xyloiulus</i> is an especially rare genus even among the rare mazon creek millipedes; characterized by short legs and vertically undivided body segments. I have also been told by a couple knowledgeable collectors that the specimen bears some resemblance to the genus <i>Euphoberia</i>.<br><br>The specimen itself shows clear segmentation, beautiful 3-dimensional preservation in parts, and even the proximal portions of some its legs which could perhaps be further prepped out. That being said, I have never seen a mazon creek <i>Xyloiulus</i> for sale before, so I don't have the best frame of reference.
