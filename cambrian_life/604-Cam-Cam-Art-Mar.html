                    This arthropod appears to be the unnamed species of <i>Marrella</i> described from the Balang Formation of China (Liu 2013), which represents the oldest occurrence of the genus. While <i>M. splendens</i> is one of the most common fossils found in the Burgess Shale of Canada, <i>Marrella sp.</i> is rare in the Balang Formation. The primary distinction of the Balang <i>Marrella</i> is supposedly its smooth median cephalic spines (the posterior pair of spines on the headshield), in contrast to the serrated median cephalic spines of <i>M. splendens</i>. That being said, the median cephalic spines on this particular specimen appear to have faint striations and possible serrations. In addition, based on the handful of specimens I have seen, the median cephalic spines on the Balang <i>Marrella</i> seem to be far longer than those of <i>M. splendens</i>; longer than the lateral cephalic spines and even extending well past the end of the body.
