                    According to Forest Gahn of BYU-I, this is likely a bizzarre mutant of <i>Reteocrinus alveolatus</i>. Quite unlike almost any other known crinoid and conflicting with its genus/species definition, this crinoid's radials bear 2 arms each on the A, C, D rays and no arms on the B, E rays. This sort of pattern is reminiscent of Cromyocrinid arm branching groupings, though that is a family of Pennsylvanian-aged cladids and thus far-removed from this specimen (an Ordovician-aged diplobathrid camerate) in time and phylogeny. In addition, according to Forest the strong association of the primanal with the C radial and its complete separation from the D radial makes it disparid-like in some respects. Perhaps this mutant hints at something fundamental to crinoid developmental programming. It has been sent to Forest for study, who also generously performed additional preparation and photography to produce the images here.
