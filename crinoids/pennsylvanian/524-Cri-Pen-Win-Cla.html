                    1. Here is a very interesting crinoid from the Pennsylvanian Winchell Formation of Brownwood, Texas. This locality is primarily known as an echinoid (urchin) lagerstatte, for producing plates of spectacularly-preserved <i>Archaeocidaris</i> specimens. The unusual crinoid here is almost certainly a <i>Clathrocrinus</i>. The bizzare zig-zag branching pattern of the ten arms is unique and different enough from all other known crinoids that Strimple erected an entirely new family (Clathrocrinidae) to accomodate it.<br><br>What is so interesting about this <i>Clathrocrinus</i> is that it appears to be undescribed/new from the Winchell Formation In the literature there are three formally-described species: <i>C. clathratus</i> and <i>C. clinatus</i> from the Pennsylvanian-Missourian of Illinois, and <i>C. grileyi</i> from the Pennsylvanian-Atokan of Oklahoma. This specimen's anal plates are consistent with the two known Missourian species, but overall the crown has features of both: broader angles of arm-branching like <i>C. clinatus</i>, and bulbous calyx plates with deep sutures between them like <i>C. clathratus</i>, though the plates aren't quite as sharp or ornate. In my opinion this <i>Clathrocrinus</i> may be a new species and possibly ancestral/transitional. However a paleontologist's assessment will be needed to make the ID conclusive.<br><br>Addendum: Georgy Mirantsev has confirmed the identification of this specimen as a <i>Clathrocrinus</i> with affinity to <i>C. clathratus</i>.
