            The characteristic low, bowl-shaped and highly sculpted cup on this crinoid is unmistakeable as Stellarocrinus, with the prominent spiny ornamentation being a notable feature. In Strimple's description of the Francis Shale fauna this form was represented by just a single cup with primaxils attached, which is possibly why it wasn't described or identified in much detail aside from noting similarity with S. exsculptus from the Wann Formation of Oklahoma.
