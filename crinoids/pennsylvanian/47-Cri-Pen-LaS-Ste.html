            "Stellarocrinus virgilensis" is one of the more common constituents of the LaSalle crinoid fauna, but no less popular or beautiful for it. The genus exhibits very widely-spraddled/well-separated thick biserial arms along with a very shallow, highly-sculpted calyx, which give its crown a very distinct appearance. Its biserial arms also exemplify a trait of so-called "advanced cladids" in the Pennsylvanian, and a departure from the primitive cladid arrangement of uniserial pinnulate arms. <br><br>Officially, the ornamentation of the calyx and presence or absence of axillary spines on the arms distinguish the two species of Stellarocrinus found in the LaSalle Limestone. However I am not personally fully convinced of this distinction, because these features seem quite variable and intermediate forms seem to exist.
