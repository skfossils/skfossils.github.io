            Here is an incredible crinoid double that I have been looking forward to getting back from prep for a while. This piece is arguably my best fossil representative of Pennsylvanian-aged crinoids and their late-Paleozoic adaptations, because it excellently preserves two prevalent and iconic Pennsylvanian crinoid types: a Pirasocrinid (Plaxocrinus on the left) and a Cromyocrinid (Parethelocrinus on the right). The Pennsylvanian period saw a rise in the cladid crinoids, along with several adaptations presumably to defend against increasing predation from fishes newly-equipped with powerful "crushing" teeth. One strategy, exhibited by crinoids such as the Cromyocrinids, was to develop a large, globose calyx comprised of a small number of extremely thick plates. This would make it rigid and resistant to crushing forces. Another strategy, exhibited chiefly by the Pirasocrinids, was to minimize the calyx and instead threaten would-be predators with a formidable array of spines protruding from the arms and from a highly-specialized anal sac. Both were evidently quite successful given the prevalence of such forms throughout the Pennsylvanian; hence why this particular specimen is such a great representative of the period.<br><br>1. This specimen is arguably the "flashier" of the two and a member of the Pirasocrinidae. According to Harrell Strimple, the arms are a key distinguishing factor between different taxa within this family. This one, with spines only from the axillary primibrachials followed by uniserial, endotomously branching arms, would be assigned to the genus "Plaxocrinus".<br><br>While fairly abundant throughout the Pennsylvanian, these pirasocrinids are almost always found only as loose calyxes and brachial/anal spines. This particular specimen is exceptionally-preserved. Especially noteworthy is the magnificent umbrella-like anal sac: it is built from circlets of porous, hexagonal plates, which transition to more stellate shapes as they approach the summit. At the termination of the anal sac is a platform of several polygonal plates surrounded by a circlet of formidable defensive spines; a veritable "crown of thorns". It is postulated that the pirasocrinid anal sac contained nutritious, high-value targets to predators such as the crinoid's viscera or gonads. The strategy was evidently to draw these away from the main body and defend it with an array of threatening spines.<br><br>There are several species of Plaxocrinus described in Strimple's original 1961 paper on the Holdenville crinoid fauna, and in my opinion there is only one among them that resembles my specimen: "Plaxocrinus sp. aff. P. dornickensis" which was represented by just a single loose calyx. Atypically for the genus, this form has a calyx with a very smooth outline owing to flat, non-bulbous basals and nonimpressed, almost imperceptible sutures. If this is what my specimen is, it may be one of if not the only known articulated crowns of its species. <br><br>Addendum: Peter Holterhoff has confirmed this crinoid as indeed being a species of Plaxocrinus similar to P. dornickensis, hence "Plaxocrinus sp. aff. P. dornickensis".<br><br>2. Here is the other half of my beautiful Holdenville double: a robust Cromyocrinid crinoid known as Parethelocrinus ellipticus. Though not as exotic-looking as the pirasocrinid, it is no less impressive of a specimen. P. ellipticus is one of the most common constituents of the Holdenville crinoid fauna but not often this complete and well-articulated.As explained in my previous posts, Cromyocrinids such as this one exemplify several general adaptive trends in the late Paleozoic cladid crinoids. For example, their calyx plates thickened and reduced in number to become more rigid and armored in response to crushing predation. This was primarily achieved through a reduction in the number of anal plates; P. ellipticus has two anal plates, down from the "primitive" three, though this is far from the most extreme case. It also exhibits the "advanced" cladid trait of robust biserial pinnulate arms, compared to the more primitive uniserial pinnulate arrangement. Though P. ellipticus generally has a smooth, unornamented calyx, certain specimens such as this one exhibit teeth-like edges to the calyx plates that give their sutures a subtle "stitched" appearance.
