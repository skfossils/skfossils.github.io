                    Here is a crinoid from one of my favorite crinoid localities. <i>Texacrinus coniformis</i>, as the species name suggests, is characterized by its particularly sharply conical cup for the genus. It also displays long, snaking, exotomously-branched arms, and the unusually-shaped radial facet-primibrachial junction occupies just a portion of the radial plates. Strimple 1961 mentioned the radial facet width to be a highly variable character within the species. However, I notice the Sam Noble Museum of Oklahoma currently names the original holotype for <i>T. coniformis</i>, which has primibrachials and radial facets about as wide as the radial plates, as <i>T. californius</i>. It is possible that there has been some species splitting or reassignment based on this trait or others since Strimple's work.
