                    This specimen was originally labeled as <i>Ethelocrinus sp.</i> presumably on account of the prominent pustular calyx ornamentation. However according to Peter Holterhoff, <i>Ethelocrinus</i> necessitates a significant basal concavity formed primarily by incurving basal plates. I believe this specimen is more consistent with the definition of <i>Parulocrinus</i>, which has a flat base with no basal concavity. All of the definitive <i>Parulocrinus</i> I am aware of have smooth, unornamented calyxes, but I don't see why an ornamented form couldn't be included in the genus as defined by Strimple & Moore 1971.
