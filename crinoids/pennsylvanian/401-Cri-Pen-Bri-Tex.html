            As you may guess from my postings, I have a love for late paleozoic crinoids. This piece is a special one despite not being a particularly impressive specimen, because it comes from the collection of none other than the late Harrell Strimple; a giant in crinoid paleontology and one of the few experts in Pennsylvanian crinoids, arguably THE expert. One of my favorite paleontologists. Sure enough, Strimple also described the Francis Shale crinoids, and according to him this particular species was fairly common but mostly found as just calyxes, occasionally with small sections of arm (so perhaps this specimen isn't too bad after all). It is notable for its small compact cup compared to other members of the genus. Interestingly, the label on this specimen also notes "immature form or new species", so it may deviate from the description in some way, though I hesitate to judge how.
