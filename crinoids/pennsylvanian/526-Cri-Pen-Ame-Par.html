                    This is a highly unusual crinoid fossil from Ohio. It appears to be a large cromyocrinid of the genus <i>Parulocrinus</i> considering its flat base, two anal plates, and extra branching in the A, C and D rays, as confirmed by Peter Holterhoff. What really makes this specimen special is its provenance. It comes from an obscure locality known as the Ames Limestone, which is a latest-Pennsylvanian (Virgilian) formation and east of the more typical North American Pennsylvanian crinoid localities. J. J. Burke wrote a series of papers in the 1900s describing various crinoids from the Ames, but to my knowledge no <i>Parulocrinus</i> or similar cromyocrinids were discussed, much less such complete crowns.<br><br>This specimen appears most similar to <i>Parulocrinus beedei</i> considering its relatively small pentagonal infrabasal circlet with large stem impression, though its size and calyx proportions are closer to those of <i>Parulocrinus blairi</i> (Moore & Plummer 1940).
