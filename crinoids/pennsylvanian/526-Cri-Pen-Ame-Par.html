                    Some prep/cleaning is needed, but I just had to talk about this fascinating Cromyocrinid crinoid. From consulting Peter Holterhoff, it is most definitely of the genus "Parulocrinus" owing to its more-or-less flat base with no significant basal concavity/convexity, plus the extra branching in the A, C and D rays.<br><br>Obviously this is an aesthetically beautiful and well-preserved crown, but what really makes it special is its provenance. It comes from an obscure locality known as the Ames Limestone, which is a latest-Pennsylvanian (Virgilian) formation and east of the more typical North American Pennsylvanian crinoid localities. J. J. Burke wrote a series of papers in the 1900s describing various crinoids from the Ames, but to my knowledge no Parulocrinus or similar Cromyocrinids were discussed, much less such complete crowns. This specimen may be a first for the locality. Considering the age, the most comparable species would be "Parulocrinus blairi" from the Virgilian-aged Stull Shale of Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas. Since the specific diagnosis of Cromyocrinids can be quite difficult and possibly outdated, for now I will consider this specimen as similar to and perhaps conspecific with "P. blairi".
