                    According to Peter Holterhoff this crinoid is of the genus <i>Parulocrinus</i>, considering its more-or-less flat base with no significant basal concavity/convexity, plus the extra branching in the A, C and D rays. What really makes it special is its provenance. It comes from an obscure locality known as the Ames Limestone, which is a latest-Pennsylvanian (Virgilian) formation and east of the more typical North American Pennsylvanian crinoid localities. J. J. Burke wrote a series of papers in the 1900s describing various crinoids from the Ames, but to my knowledge no <i>Parulocrinus</i> or similar Cromyocrinids were discussed, much less such complete crowns. This specimen may be a first for the locality. Considering the age, the most comparable species would be <i>Parulocrinus blairi</i> from the Virgilian-aged Stull Shale of Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas. Since the specific diagnosis of Cromyocrinids can be quite difficult and possibly outdated, for now I will consider this specimen as similar to and perhaps conspecific with <i>P. blairi</i>.
