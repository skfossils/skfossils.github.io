                    This is a highly unusual crinoid fossil from Ohio. It appears to be a large cromyocrinid of the genus <i>Parulocrinus</i> considering its flat base, two anal plates, and extra branching in the A, C and D rays, as confirmed by Peter Holterhoff. What really makes this specimen special is its provenance. It comes from an obscure locality known as the Ames Limestone, which is a latest-Pennsylvanian (Virgilian) formation and east of the more typical North American Pennsylvanian crinoid localities. J. J. Burke wrote a series of papers in the 1900s describing various crinoids from the Ames, but to my knowledge no <i>Parulocrinus</i> or similar cromyocrinids were discussed, much less such complete crowns.<br><br>Among members of the genus this specimen most closely resembles <i>Parulocrinus pontiacensis</i>, given the impressed sutures of the calyx plates and its small, pentagonal, mildly petaloid infrabasal circlet (Strimple & Moore 1971). On the other hand, its columnar cicatrix (i.e. stem attachment surface) is larger and its infrabasals shorter; closer to the proportions of <i>Parulocrinus beedei</i> (Moore & Plummer 1940), another similar-looking species. As far as I can tell neither of these two have been reported from the Virgilian, with their occurrences being restricted to Missourian-aged strata.
