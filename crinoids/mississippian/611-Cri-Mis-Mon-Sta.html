                    <i>Staphylocrinus</i> is a fascinating stemless crinoid similar to the likewise stemless <i>Agassizocrinus</i>. These crinoids appear to have fused their infrabasal plates into singular solid infrabasal disks/cones and detached from their stems during development like modern free-swimming comatulid crinoids, though unlike comatulids they presumably lived a benthic lifestyle on the seafloor. Oftentimes the infrabasals show evidence of this process as a scar or depression, and sometimes the remnant stem can even be observed in cross-section (Burdick & Strimple 1969). <br><br><i>Staphylocrinus</i> is distinguished by its bowl-shaped calyx with tumid plates and notably tumid infrabasals that project below the basals, in addition to multiple branchings in the arms. Its genus name derives from <i>staphylos</i> (Greek) meaning a cluster of grapes, which refers to the appearance of the calyx owing to the tumidity of its plates (Burdick & Strimple 1969).
