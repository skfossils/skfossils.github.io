            Exochocrinus is an obscure and unusual crinoid that lacked a stem, and it presumably lived a benthic lifestyle on the seafloor. It is related to the likewise stemless benthic crinoids Agassizocrinus and Staphylocrinus under the family Agassizocrinidae. These crinoids fused their infrabasal plates into singular solid infrabasal discs/cones, and likely detached from the stem during development like modern free-swimming Comatulid crinoids (Burdick & Strimple 1969).<br><br>The main trait that distinguishes Exochocrinus from the closely-related Staphylocrinus is its very small, flat, and nearly pentagonal infrabasal disc that lies within a deep basal concavity, as well as significantly larger and more bulbous basal plates on which it probably sat in life.<br><br>"Exochocrinus tumulosus" is the only species of Exochocrinus described from North America. In my opinion this specimen seems more-or-less consistent with the description of E. tumulosus, but the crinoid is a poorly-understood taxon and I lack the proper expertise to identify it with certainty.
