                    <i>Exochocrinus</i> is a highly unusual stemless crinoid similar to the likewise stemless <i>Agassizocrinus</i> and <i>Staphylocrinus</i>, though it appears to be more closely related to the latter. The main trait that distinguishes this crinoid is its small, flat, and nearly pentagonal infrabasal disk that lies within a basal concavity, as well as significantly larger and more tumid (i.e. swollen/bulbous) basal plates on which it probably sat in life. Its name derives from <i>exochos</i> (Greek) which roughly means "exquisite/extreme", and refers to the extremely tumid nature of the basal and radial plates (Burdick & Strimple 1969). <br><br><i>Exochocrinus</i> is also exceptionally rare to the point of obscurity, especially in terms of articulated specimens. Two partial calyxes were known for the original description in 1969, and in 1981 a calyx with the axillary first primibrachials attached was described from Oklahoma (Strimple 1981). In that same 1981 paper, Strimple mentioned the existence of a more complete <i>Exochocrinus</i> crown with arms similar to those of the genus <i>Staphylocrinus</i>, i.e. "20 uniserial arms that branch on primibrachs 1 and commonly on secundibrachs 6", but this specimen has not been officially figured or described. From what I can see, there seems to have been no further description of more complete crowns since. With that context, the specimen shown here is quite special in that it preserves a significant length of arms, especially on the A and B rays which preserve up to secundibrachs 7 and 6 respectively. There is no indication of a second branching, which would otherwise occur at secundibrachs 8 and 7 at the earliest.<br><br>Addendum: Upon closer examination, there appears to be a significant length of extraordinarily thin, delicate stem still attached to the infrabasal disk of this specimen. <i>Exochocrinus tumulosus</i> is the only species of <i>Exochocrinus</i> described from North America, and all characterizations in the literature describe a complete lack of any stem, along with a columnar cicatrix (i.e. scar) on the infrabasal disk. I don't believe this peculiarity can simply be attributed to immaturity, because this specimen is well-within the size range of presumably mature <i>Exochocrinus</i> specimens in the literature. However, this taxon is poorly-represented and relatively poorly-understood. In any case, this stem was almost certainly too weak to elevate the crinoid up in the water, and probably worked more as a tether akin to a "ball and chain", if it was functional at all. In addition, in my opinion the infrabasal disk on this specimen is closer to a proper pentagon with rounded vertices, as opposed to typical <i>E. tumulosus</i> whose infrabasal disk appears nearly star-shaped due to its sharp, "pinched out" vertices. This specimen may be an atypical example of <i>E. tumulosus</i> or perhaps a new species of <i>Exochocrinus</i> altogether. <br><br>Addendum 2: Though this specimen is somewhat crushed, I am not sure that its infrabasals would be completely concealed in a deep basal concavity as is typical for <i>Exochocrinus</i> given the size of its infrabasals and the shapes and suture positions of its basals. I also notice this specimen bears some similarities to a crinoid that Strimple described as <i>Staphylocrinus supratumulosus</i>, which has particularly strong calyx plate tumidity that starts not at the sutures but slightly away from them, as well as small nodes or granulations on the calyx plates and brachials (Burdick & Strimple 1969). That being said, this specimen's infrabasals are still notably smaller and flatter than its basals compared to the figured holotype of <i>S. supratumulosus</i>. Moreover, the single poorly-preserved holotype is the only known specimen of <i>S. supratumulosus</i>, and I am not certain that it is a valid taxon.
