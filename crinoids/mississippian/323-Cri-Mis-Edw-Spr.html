                    Here is an impressive, very obscure and unusual crinoid from a familiar locality. <i>Springericrinus magniventrus</i> is a massive cladid crinoid from Crawfordsville, with the preserved crown on this specimen reaching over 12 cm. Most notable is the enormously large and wide, corrugated anal sac, along with a conical calyx made of strongly-ornamented thin plates, and with relatively thin, rounded, uniserial branched arms. To me these features are reminiscent of Dendrocrinids such as <i>Dendrocrinus</i> and especially <i>Plicodendrocrinus</i> for the "plicate" anal sac, which are much older and typically seen from the Ordovician and Silurian (though the arms on these are non-pinnulate). Without identification and provenance, I would not have guessed this to be a Mississippian crinoid.
