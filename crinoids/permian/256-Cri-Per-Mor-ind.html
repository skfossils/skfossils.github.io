            This is a Permian-aged crinoid crown from Texas and one of my most unusual fossils. According to Peter Holterhoff the upflared infrabasal plates suggest assignment to the genus "Ulocrinus" among the Cromyocrinids. However, according to Georgy Mirantsev the 16 biserial arms (with four arms on the A, C and D rays) point more to the genus "Parulocrinus". Overall this is quite an odd specimen of uncertain identity, possessing an Ulocrinus-like calyx with Parulocrinus-like arms. If not consistent with a preexisting definition, this specimen may be of a new genus and/or species.
