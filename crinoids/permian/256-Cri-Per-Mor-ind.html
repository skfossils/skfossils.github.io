                    This is a Permian-aged crinoid crown from Texas and one of my most unusual fossils. According to Peter Holterhoff the upflared infrabasal plates and resulting urn-like calyx suggest assignment to the genus <i>Ulocrinus</i>. However, according to Georgy Mirantsev the 16 biserial arms (with four arms on the A, C and D rays) suggest closer affinity to the genus <i>Parulocrinus</i>. Overall this is quite an odd specimen that exhibits a combination of traits from both genera. Dr. Holterhoff believes it to have evolved either from <i>Ulocrinus</i> (which has 10 biserial arms) by developing >10 arms, or from a 16-armed Cromyocrinid with a typically flat-to-concave base by reverting to a "primitive" urn-like calyx. In any case it does not seem to fit any preexisting definitions and appears to be new genus of Permian crinoid. "Neoulocrinus" or "Novulocrinus" may be appropriate tentative names considering the crinoid's affinities and relatively young age.
