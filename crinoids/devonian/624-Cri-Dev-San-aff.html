                    This is a highly unusual crinoid from the Devonian of Spain. It closely resembles <i>Costalocrinus ibericus</i> from slightly younger Emsian strata of Spain, but lacks the enlarged anal X which articulates with the proximal brachials of the C and D rays. <i>C. ibericus</i> in turn closely resembles the prolific Mississippian genus <i>Barycrinus rhombiferous</i> in its wide, uniserial nonpinnulate arms, but is distinguished by the aforementioned enlarged anal X (which also defines the genus), in addition to strong, rib-like calyx ornamentation. Due to the resemblance, <i>C. ibericus</i> is presumed to be close to the ancestral split between <i>Costalocrinus</i> and <i>Barycrinus</i> (Kammer 2001). This specimen, which lacks the defining feature of the genus <i>Costalocrinus</i> which also chiefly distinguishes <i>C. ibericus</i> from <i>B. rhombiferous</i>, appears to be even more close to <i>Barycrinus</i> and seems to have questionable generic assignment. According to George McIntosh, this crinoid may represent a new genus and/or a transitional form.
