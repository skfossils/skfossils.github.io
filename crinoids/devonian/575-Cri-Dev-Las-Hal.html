                    Jan Bohatý has identified this specimen as <i>Halocrinites inflatus</i> (Schultze 1866).<br><br>The cupressocrinitids are a higly distinctive family of Devonian crinoids found in Europe and Africa but not North America. They are characterized by robust, uniserial unbranched arms comprised of a low number of hyperpinnulated brachials. Especially unusual are the thin and wide first primibrachials, so much so that at a glance they may be passed over as simply a sharp rim around the top of the calyx.<br><br>Cupressocrinitid classification has historically been complex and confusing, but recent work has revised and standardized this family, distinguishing <i>Halocrinites</i> from <i>Cupressocrinites</i> on the basis of an anatomical feature known as the "exoplacoid layer" (Bohatý 2005, Bohatý & Ausich 2021). Essentially, cupressocrinitids with a multilayered external surface akin to growth lines parallel to the plate edges (formally called a "multilamellar exoplacoid layer") are assigned to the genus <i>Halocrinites</i>. This specimen is an example of <i>Halocrinites inflatus</i>, which true to its specific name is characterized by strongly inflated/bulbous brachials that give the arms a "beads on a string" appearance. It also preserves the multilamellar exoplacoid layer in great detail.
