                    This type of fossil was initially described as a crinoid known as <i>Camarocrinus ulrichi</i>. Eventually (and presumably after the well-preserved Moroccan <i>Scyphocrinites</i> were found highly associated with similar structures), it was re-evaluated as being a <i>Scyphocrinites</i> crinoid's lobolith, which is a float-like holdfast that would fill will gas and suspend the crinoid upside down in the water to live a drifting, pseudoplanktonic lifestyle. This particular specimen is from the Devonian instead of the Silurian, so evidently <i>Scyphocrinites</i> also occurs in the Devonian of the USA, though I have not yet looked into the literature.
