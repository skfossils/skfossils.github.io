            Some fossils are preserved as hollow casts, sometimes stained orange-red from iron. Such is the case for many crinoids found in the Devonian-aged Belen Formation of Bolivia, which seem poorly studied. This presumably undescribed crinoid shows a camerate-like calyx with a beautiful spinose anal tube, an unusually thick stem relative to the calyx, and what may be a pinnulated arm preserved.
