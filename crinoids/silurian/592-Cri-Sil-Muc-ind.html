                    This crinoid exhibits features of the family Marsupiocrinidae (Ausich & Cournoyer 2019) but is clearly distinct from <i>Marsupiocrinites coelatus</i>, the only Marsupiocrinid described from Dudley (Phillips 1839, Donovan et al. 2008, Donovan 2009). <br><br>Three key differences are: <br><br>1. Three arms per ray (due to asymmetrically branching secundibrachials) resulting in 15 biserial arms, as opposed to four arms per ray and 20 biserial arms which <i>M. coelatus</i> is invariably described to have. <br><br>2. A significant basal concavity as opposed to the flat base in <i>M. coelatus</i>. <br><br>3. Lack of the radiating ridge calyx ornamentation seen in <i>M. coelatus</i>.<br><br>Another apparently conspecific specimen in the collection of Michael Lask also shares all of these features, which makes it unlikely that these are simply one-off variations/mutations from <i>M. coelatus</i>.<br><br>Moreover, this crinoid is not consistent with any one of the currently recognized Marsupiocrinid genera, but rather possesses a unique combination of features from among them (Ausich & Cournoyer 2019). Assuming these sources are exhaustive, this crinoid appears to be undescribed from Dudley and perhaps of a new/undescribed genus entirely. <br><br>Addendum: William Ausich agrees with my assessment of this crinoid.
