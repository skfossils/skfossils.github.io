                    A classic Dudley crinoid, "Clematocrinus retiarius" is a very small species with a crown size generally of 2cm or less, and I believe the most common crinoid of the Wenlock Limestone. Its most notable feature is its remarkably long, tendril-like cirri distributed in clusters along the length of the stem. Crinoid cirri are mobile(!) appendages that help anchor the animal in place. While they are hardly unique to this species, they are absent in many Paleozoic crinoids and rarely as proportionately long as in "C. retiarius".
