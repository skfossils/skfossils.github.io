                    This specimen is mostly consistent with the description of <i>Protaxocrinus sideros</i> (Ausich & Copper 2010), but with a few oddities. The arms' brachials are incredibly wide, easily 3-4 times wider than high for the primibrachials and secundibrachials, as opposed to being around twice as wide (Ausich & Copper 2010). In fact, the first primibrachials are significantly larger and wider than even the radials, and laterally-abutting each other from adjacent rays. Moreover, the proximal brachials are hexagonal in shape and laterally-pointed, as opposed to being rectangular with smooth lateral surfaces (Ausich & Copper 2010). <br><br>William Ausich believes this specimen may fit withinin the range of <i>P. sideros</i> morphology. He has also pointed out evidence of non-lethal predation followed by regeneration in some of the very thin distal arms. <br><br>Also note the very strong coiling of one of the distal arm branches, which is a rarely-seen feature due to the incurving nature of typical flexible crinoid arms.
