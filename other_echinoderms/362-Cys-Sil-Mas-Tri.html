                    This is an impressive slab of six naturally-associated diploporite cystoids: one <i>Triamara</i> and five <i>Holocystites</i>. The <i>Triamara</i> has been prepped so that it can "pop out" of its original pocket.<br><br>1. Here is one of my non-crinoid echinoderms, a large cystoid known as <i>Triamara cutleri</i> (a.k.a. <i>Triamara ventricosa</i>). It's from the Silurian Massie/Osgood Shale of Indiana, which produces an unusual abundance of these diploporite cystoids relative to other echinoderms. <i>Triamara</i> is a cystoid in the shape of an elongated, bulbous sac made of porous plates. Its most interesting and unique feature is the three unequally-long ambulacral grooves at the top of the theca which join to form a characteristic "Y" shape (also note the anal opening to the left of the "Y"). At the end of each ambulacral groove are the attachment sites for a pair of brachioles, indicating the cystoid posessed a total of six filter-feeding arms.
