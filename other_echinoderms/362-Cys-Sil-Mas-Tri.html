            1. Here is one of my non-crinoid echinoderms, a large cystoid known as "Triamara cutleri" (a.k.a. Triamara ventricosa). It's from the Silurian Osgood/Massie Shale of Indiana, which produces an unusual abundance of these diploporite cystoids relative to other echinoderms. Triamara is a cystoid in the shape of an elongated, bulbous sac made of porous plates. Its most interesting and unique feature is the three unequally-long ambulacral grooves at the top of the calyx which join to form a characteristic "Y" shape (shown in the third photo; also note the anal opening to the left of the "Y"). At the end of each ambulacral groove are the attachment sites for a pair of brachioles, indicating the cystoid posessed a total of six filter-feeding arms.
