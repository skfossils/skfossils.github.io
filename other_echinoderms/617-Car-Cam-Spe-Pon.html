                    <i>Ponticulocarpus robinsoni</i> (Sumrall & Sprinkle 1999) is a cornute, a type of carpoid possessing a bizarre asymmetrical theca and a single tail-like appendage known as an aulacophore. <i>P. robinsoni</i> exhibits some unusual features compared to other cornutes, namely the incredibly wide and thin glossal and spinal processes thought to assist in burrowing into substrate, and the several bridges of extra plates linking parts of its marginal rim. This latter feature also gives the taxon its name, with <i>ponticulus</i> being Latin for "little bridge". <br><br>This specimen exhibits both the glossal and spinous processes, the small irregular plates throughout the ventral surface of the theca, and an aulacophore with partially opened cover plates (visible as the line of spine-like serrations along its edge).
